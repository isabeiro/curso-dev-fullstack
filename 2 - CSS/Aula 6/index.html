        Hello! My name is Isabela, I'm 28 years old and live in São Paulo, Brazil. I'm graduated in civil engeneering, with an MBA in Project Manager by FGV. I've worked as an freelancer engineer for five years and got some experience in the area. But, as I was looking for a change in my carrer and life, in 2021 I started studing to became a Full Stack Developer since I got really interested in that area and It'll bring me a lot of new opportunities.
